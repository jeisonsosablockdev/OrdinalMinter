### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.taal.com/\#transaction-processing)    Transaction Processing

As a Transaction processor (or miner) TAAL validates clients transactions and time stamps them by sequencing and encoding them into blocks, which are then published and added to the BSV blockchain.

TAAL API is an easy to integrate, open communication channel to the blockchain. By connecting an application to this endpoint data, in the form of transactions, can be processed, instantly verified, and once settled this data can be viewed anytime. Creating great value to applications that require real time blockchain data at scale, now and into the future.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.taal.com/\#digital-asset-tokenization-with-the-1sat-ordinals-protocol)    Digital Asset Tokenization with the 1Sat Ordinals protocol

1SatOrdinals in an implementation of Ordinals running on the BSV blockchain. The tokens represent individual satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) that are "inscribed" with specific data, such as images or text. 1Sat Ordinals on BSV are fast, inexpensive, and fully scriptable via native Bitcoin Script.

### [Direct link to heading](https://docs.taal.com/\#other-benefits)    Other benefits

- The ability to have low-cost transactions (less than a penny), which make a difference when issuers are dropping millions of NFTs, for example. This attribute means more margin for the issuers on primary and secondary markets.

- Interoperability with ecosystem wallets and other blockchain platforms.

- Transparency allows the token to be tracked throughout its lifecycle, which makes a difference in a regulatory environment.

- No network congestion — as the tokens are issued at the network level on a blockchain that scales unbounded.
