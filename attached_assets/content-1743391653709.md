**Yours Wallet** is an open-source SPV wallet for BSV and [1Sat Ordinals](https://docs.1satordinals.com/) that enables access to decentralized applications developed on [Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.com/). View the official Github repo [here](https://github.com/yours-org/yours-wallet).

Yours Wallet generates and manages private keys for its users in a non-custodial manner, ensuring that the users have full control over their funds and transactions. These keys can be utilized within the wallet to securely store funds and authorize transactions. Developers can seamlessly interact with Yours through the [Chrome Web Browser](https://yours.org/), providing a user-friendly interface for wallet management and decentralized application use.

When interfacing with web applications, Yours Wallet introduces a `yours` object into the javascript context of each visited site. Consequently, web apps may communicate with Yours, requesting user permission to execute transactions via this injected provider. This guide is crafted for developers looking to integrate Yours Wallet!
